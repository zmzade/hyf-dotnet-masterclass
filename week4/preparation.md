# Week 4 - Preparation

We are going to learn some new concepts this week.
I suggest reading the following:

- [C# Interface](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_interface.php)
- [Video: C# Interfaces explained in simple terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ8YkJrAbzE&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)
- [Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core - Tutorialsteacher.com](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/core/dependency-injection-in-aspnet-core)
- [Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core - Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-6.0). This might not be the easiest read so don't be sorry if you don't understand everything - but try to see if you can make sense of it.

## Mealsharing
We will begin starting a project for the MealSharing app with a .NET Backend.
So:
- Revisit your own implementation of the Mealsharing from the HYF curriculum and refamiliarize yourself with how it works.
- Consider: Which are the main models we should implement. Make a list and we will discuss in class.
- Consider: Which controllers and actions should we implement? How should their signature be? Make a list and we will discuss in class.
