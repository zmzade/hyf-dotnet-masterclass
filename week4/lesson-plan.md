# Week 4 : ASP.NET Core

## Pre-requisites:
Same as previous lessons

## Lesson Plan:

### 1 Interfaces
We will take a closer look at interfaces and what you can use them for.

### 2 Service classes and Dependency Injection
Now, it's time for yet another Design Pattern: Inversion of Control. We won't get too theoretical - but instead see how this works in action in ASP.NET Core with Dependency Injection - and build our first Service that can be accessed through Dependency Injection.

### 3 Starting on the Mealsharing API (creating first controllers and models)
We will start creating the backend Rest API for the mealsharing app, defining models, controllers and actions - as well as the relevant services.
