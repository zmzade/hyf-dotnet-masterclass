## Dapper ##

## Let`s code ##

1. Install `Visual NuGet` extension to your VS Code
2. Copy `week 4` homework to `week 5` directory
3. Install `Dapper` & `MySql.Data` package from NuGet
4. Create `MealRepository` class that implements `IMealRepository` interface. Take inspiration from Dapper Demo project to implement all methods.
    - Add meal
    - Get one meal
    - List all meals
    - Delete (for those who have it in week 4 homework)

5. Register  `MealRepository` instead of `InMemoryMealRepository` in your `Program.cs`

6. Try running and calling endpoints from the Swagger
